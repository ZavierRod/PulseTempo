# PulseTempo Development Roadmap

This document outlines the complete development plan for taking PulseTempo from prototype to production-ready iOS app.

---

## Overview

**Total Timeline:** 13-17 weeks
**Current Status:** Phase 4.3 Complete - Full bidirectional workout sync implemented! All core phases (1–4) are functionally complete. Full auth flow (email/password), BPM matching (HR + cadence modes), watchOS app with all sync states, and backend (auth, tracks, runs) deployed on Railway. **Next:** Sign in with Apple end-to-end, backend hardening, then Phase 5 (AI DJ).

---

## Product Vision

### Core Concept
PulseTempo is a workout music app that intelligently matches your music to your heart rate in real-time, creating a seamless flow state during runs and workouts.

### How It Works

#### 1. **Run Start**
- User starts a workout session
- App plays either:
  - A random track from selected playlists, OR
  - A user-chosen track
- **Rationale**: User isn't warmed up yet, so BPM matching isn't critical at this stage

#### 2. **During Workout (Continuous BPM Matching)**
- App continuously monitors heart rate via **Apple Watch** or **Garmin Venu 3S**
- As HR changes, app intelligently selects the NEXT track that matches current HR
- **Key Principle**: Never interrupt the currently playing song
- Next track is queued and ready to play when:
  - Current song ends naturally, OR
  - User manually skips forward/backward

#### 3. **Smart Track Selection Algorithm**
When selecting the next track, the app scores each available track using:
- **BPM Match (60% weight)**: How close is the track's BPM to current heart rate?
- **Variety (20% weight)**: Avoid recently played tracks to keep workout fresh
- **Energy (20% weight)**: Match HR zone to appropriate BPM range (e.g., high HR → high-energy tracks)

#### 4. **User Experience Goals**
- ✅ **Non-disruptive**: Songs never cut off mid-play
- ✅ **Predictable**: Users know what to expect
- ✅ **Flow state**: Music adapts to effort without breaking rhythm
- ✅ **User control**: Can skip anytime, or let it play naturally
- ✅ **Intelligent**: Learns from workout patterns and avoids repetition

#### 5. **Future Enhancement: Cadence Matching** 🔮
> **Note**: This feature will be implemented after the core HR-based matching is complete and tested.

- **Concept**: Match music BPM to your running cadence (steps per minute)
- **How it works**:
  - Apple Watch or Garmin Venu 3S tracks steps per minute during run
  - App selects tracks with BPM matching your cadence
  - Same queue-based, non-disruptive approach as HR matching
- **User choice**: Toggle between HR matching mode or Cadence matching mode
- **Advanced option**: Hybrid mode that considers both HR and cadence
- **Use case**: Runners who want music rhythm to match their footstrike pattern
- **Benefits**:
  - Natural synchronization between movement and music
  - Can help maintain consistent running pace
  - Different workout feel compared to HR-based matching

### Key Differentiators
1. **Queue-based matching** (not mid-song interruption)
2. **Real-time HR monitoring** with Apple Watch or Garmin Venu 3S integration
3. **Smart scoring algorithm** (not just simple BPM matching)
4. **Workout-aware** (understands warm-up, steady state, cool-down)
5. **Demo mode** for development/testing without compatible wearable
6. **Dual matching modes** (future): HR-based OR Cadence-based matching

- [ ] Multiple rapid skip backwards (5+ times)
- [ ] Alternating skip forward/backward rapidly
- [ ] Skip backward at start of workout (no previous track)
- [ ] Skip forward at end of playlist
- [ ] Track history maintains correct order
- [ ] `tracksPlayed` array doesn't grow unbounded
- [ ] `playedTrackIds` set updates correctly

**Edge Cases:**
- [ ] No playlists selected
- [ ] No tracks in selected playlists
- [ ] Network errors during playlist fetch
- [ ] MusicKit authorization denied
- [ ] HealthKit authorization denied
- [ ] App backgrounding during workout

Based on the code, the bugs are probably caused by:

Race conditions - Multiple rapid taps trigger async operations that overlap
Array manipulation issues - skipToPreviousTrack() removes items from tracksPlayed which can cause index errors
State inconsistency - currentTrack, tracksPlayed, and playedTrackIds get out of sync
Recommended Fix Approach
When you write tests, you'll likely need to:

Add debouncing - Prevent rapid button taps from triggering multiple operations
Add guards - Check array bounds before removing items
Synchronize state - Ensure all three data structures update atomically
Add logging - Track state changes for debugging

### Known Bugs 🐛

#### Duplicate "NOW PLAYING" Log (Low Priority)
**Status:** Partially Fixed | **Severity:** Cosmetic (logging only)

**Symptom:** When a new track starts playing, the "▶️ NOW PLAYING" log appears twice in the console.

**Root Cause:** MusicKit's `player.queue.objectWillChange` fires multiple times for a single track change. Despite adding:
- `removeDuplicates()` based on song ID
- `debounce(for: .milliseconds(100))`
- `lastLoggedSongId` guard in `updateCurrentTrack()`
- Removing `@MainActor` to make calls synchronous

The duplicate still occurs, suggesting MusicKit emits queue change events with different internal state before the song ID becomes consistent.

**Impact:** 
- ✅ "Marked as played" tracking works correctly (1 per track)
- ✅ Playback functionality unaffected
- ⚠️ Console logs show duplicate "NOW PLAYING" (cosmetic only)

**Fix Attempts:**
1. Added `removeDuplicates()` with song ID extraction - Partial improvement
2. Removed `Task { @MainActor in }` wrapper - Partial improvement
3. Removed `currentTrack` assignment from `play()` - Partial improvement
4. Removed `@MainActor` from `updateCurrentTrack()` - No additional improvement

**Future Investigation:** May require deeper MusicKit queue observer behavior analysis or switching to `player.state.playbackStatus` observation instead.

### Testing Tools & Frameworks

**Recommended:**
- XCTest (built-in)
- Quick/Nimble (BDD-style testing)
- Mockingbird or SwiftyMocky (mocking framework)
- SnapshotTesting (UI regression testing)

### 2.2 Database Schema

**Key Tables:**
- `users` - User accounts and Apple Music IDs
- `tracks` - Track metadata with BPM and confidence scores
- `playlists` - User playlists
- `playlist_tracks` - Many-to-many relationship
- `runs` - Run session summaries
- `run_tracks` - Tracks played during runs with HR data
- `heart_rate_samples` - Detailed HR data for analytics

### 2.3 BPM Service

#### Endpoints
- `POST /api/tracks/register` - Register tracks from Apple Music
- `GET /api/bpm/{track_id}` - Get BPM for a track
- `POST /api/bpm/batch` - Get BPM for multiple tracks

#### BPM Pipeline
1. Check local database cache
2. Query getSongBPM API
3. Query alternative APIs (Spotify, MusicBrainz)
4. Audio analysis fallback (librosa/Essentia)
5. Store results with confidence scores

**Implementation:**
- Exponential backoff for API failures
- Rate limiting for external APIs
- Cache successful results indefinitely
- Background job queue for bulk lookups

### 2.4 Run Analytics ✅ **COMPLETED**

#### Endpoints
- ✅ `POST /api/runs` - Save run summary with avg HR, avg cadence, track list
- ✅ `GET /api/runs/` - Get user's run history (with auth)
- ⏳ `GET /api/runs/{run_id}/details` - Detailed run data (not yet implemented)
- ⏳ `GET /api/users/{user_id}/stats` - Aggregate statistics (not yet implemented)

### 2.5 Authentication & Account Management ✅ **MOSTLY COMPLETE**

#### Capabilities
- ✅ User registration with email/password + JWT issuance
- ✅ Login with email or username
- ✅ JWT access token + refresh token flow
- ✅ `/api/auth/me` endpoint for session validation on app launch
- ✅ `apple_auth.py` — Apple token verification utility exists
- ⚠️ `/api/auth/apple` endpoint (Sign in with Apple route) — **NOT YET WIRED UP** in the router

#### iOS Integration Points
- ✅ `AuthenticationView` handles register/login with email/password and calls backend
- ✅ `KeychainManager` stores and retrieves JWT tokens securely
- ✅ `AuthService.shared` manages auth state across the app
- ✅ `APIService` injects `Authorization: Bearer` headers on all authenticated requests
- ✅ `OnboardingCoordinator` checks auth state before advancing to permission steps
- ⚠️ **Sign in with Apple** — iOS UI side not yet connected (requires `/api/auth/apple` backend route first)

---

## **Phase 3: Integration & Refinement** ✅ **MOSTLY COMPLETE**

### 3.1 iOS-Backend Integration ✅ **COMPLETED**

#### Networking Layer
- ✅ `APIService.swift` — created, handles all backend communication
- ✅ JWT auth injected via `AuthService` + `KeychainManager`
- ✅ Token refresh logic implemented in `AuthService.refreshTokens()`
- ✅ Completed run sessions saved to backend from `RunSessionViewModel.saveRunToBackend()`
- ⏳ Offline caching / sync for runs not yet implemented (runs are fire-and-forget)

### 3.2 BPM Matching Algorithm ✅ **COMPLETED**

#### Queue-Based Smart Selection Logic — Fully Implemented in `RunSessionViewModel`

**Core Behavior:** ✅ All implemented
- ✅ Random initial track at run start
- ✅ Continuous HR/cadence monitoring → updates queued next track
- ✅ Non-disruptive: only queues next track, never cuts current song
- ✅ Queue updates on: natural song end, skip forward, skip backward
- ✅ **BPM Lock** — freeze target HR/cadence to maintain queue during rest periods
- ✅ **Cadence Matching mode** — separate `.cadenceMatching` `RunMode` that queues against SPM instead of BPM
- ✅ Skip debouncing (0.3s) + navigation on background `DispatchQueue` to prevent race conditions
- ✅ Mid-workout track injection (`addTracksToWorkout()`) via MusicSearch sheet

**Scoring Components:** ✅ All implemented
- ✅ BPM Match (60% weight)
- ✅ Variety (20% weight) — penalizes recently played via `playedTrackIds`
- ✅ Energy (20% weight) — HR zone mapped to BPM range

### 3.3 Data Persistence ⏳ **PARTIAL**

#### Local Storage
- ✅ Run history fetched from backend and displayed on Home screen
- ⏳ No CoreData/SwiftData local cache — requires live backend connection
- ⏳ No offline-first mode for run history

### 3.4 Settings & Preferences ✅ **COMPLETED**

- ✅ `SettingsView.swift` — exists with wearable selection, account info, playlist management
- ✅ `WearableDeviceManager` — persists device preference (Apple Watch / Garmin / Demo)

---

## **Phase 4: Wearable Companion Apps** (3-4 weeks)

> **Note**: This phase now includes both Apple Watch and Garmin Venu 3S companion app development.
> **Status**: Garmin Venu 3S integration (Option B - HealthKit Sync) ✅ **COMPLETED** (Dec 12, 2024)
> **Status**: Apple Watch integration ✅ **COMPLETED** (Jan 20, 2026) - watchOS app + WatchConnectivity working

### ✅ RESOLVED: Apple Watch Heart Rate (Jan 20, 2026)

**Problem Discovered (Jan 19, 2026):**
When testing Apple Watch mode, heart rate data was not being received. The run completed with `Avg HR: 0, Max HR: 0`.

**Root Cause:**
The iOS app attempted to get live Apple Watch heart rate by starting an `HKWorkoutSession` on the **iPhone**, but this doesn't work. Live heart rate streaming from Apple Watch requires the workout session to run **on the Apple Watch itself**.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. ✅ Created watchOS companion app with `HKWorkoutSession` running on watch
2. ✅ Implemented `WatchConnectivity` framework to stream HR data from watch → iPhone in real-time
3. ✅ Updated iOS `HeartRateService` to receive HR via `WatchConnectivityManager`
4. ✅ Added real-time cadence calculation and streaming
5. ✅ iOS UI displays cadence (SPM) alongside heart rate

**Verification (Jan 20, 2026):**
```
📥 [iOS] Received message from watch: ["cadence": 0, "bpm": 49, "type": heartRate]
💓 [iOS] Received from watch - HR: 49 BPM, Cadence: 0 SPM
```

### 4.2 Apple Watch-iPhone Communication ✅ **COMPLETED**

#### WatchConnectivity Implementation

**Message Types (Watch → iPhone):**
```swift
// Heart rate update (sent every 1-2 seconds during workout)
["type": "heartRate", "bpm": 145.0, "timestamp": Date()]

// Workout state change
["type": "workoutState", "state": "started"] // or "stopped", "paused"
```

**Message Types (iPhone → Watch):**
```swift
// Request workout start/stop
["type": "command", "action": "startWorkout"] // or "stopWorkout"

// Current track info (optional enhancement)
["type": "nowPlaying", "title": "Song Name", "artist": "Artist"]
```

#### Communication Strategy
- Use `sendMessage(_:replyHandler:errorHandler:)` for real-time HR (requires watch reachable)
- Use `transferUserInfo(_:)` as fallback for non-critical data
- Handle `sessionReachabilityDidChange` to show connection status

**Files created:**
- `PulseTempo/Services/WatchConnectivityManager.swift` (iOS) ✅
- `PulseTempo Watch App Watch App/WorkoutManager.swift` (watchOS) ✅
- `PulseTempo Watch App Watch App/ContentView.swift` (watchOS) ✅

### 4.3 Bidirectional Workout Sync ✅ **COMPLETED** (Mar 1, 2026)

> **Goal:** Premium UX where starting a workout on either device seamlessly syncs to the other, with intelligent handling when the counterpart app isn't open.

#### User Experience Flows

**Flow 1: Watch First → Phone Notification**
```

```

**Flow 3: Both Apps Open (Happy Path)**
- `sendMessage` delivers instantly (both reachable)
- Other device receives command, starts/syncs within ~100ms
- **Seamless** — feels like one unified app

#### Communication Strategy

**Hybrid Approach (Recommended):**
1. **Try `sendMessage` first** — instant if counterpart is reachable
2. **Fall back to `updateApplicationContext`** — persists state for later
3. **On app launch** — check `receivedApplicationContext` for pending workout state

**Why Hybrid?**
| Method | Behavior | Use Case |
|--------|----------|----------|
| `sendMessage` | Instant, requires both apps reachable | Real-time sync |
| `applicationContext` | Persists, delivered on next launch | Offline recovery |
| Local Notification | Prompts user to open other app | UX guidance |

#### Message Types

**New Messages (Watch → iPhone):**
```swift
// Request workout start (watch wants phone to start)
["type": "workoutRequest", "action": "start", "timestamp": Date()]

// Confirm workout started (watch started successfully)
["type": "workoutStarted", "timestamp": Date()]
```

**New Messages (iPhone → Watch):**
```swift
// Request workout start (phone wants watch to start)
["type": "workoutRequest", "action": "start", "timestamp": Date()]

// Confirm workout started with music (phone ready)
["type": "workoutStarted", "musicReady": true, "timestamp": Date()]
```

#### Implementation — ✅ All implemented

**Step 1: Workout Request Message Handling** ✅
- ✅ Watch: `"workoutRequest"` message type in `PhoneConnectivityManager`
- ✅ iPhone: `"workoutRequest"` message type in `WatchConnectivityManager`
- ✅ Both: Post `NotificationCenter` notification when request received

**Step 2: "Waiting" State UI** ✅
- ✅ Watch: `WorkoutSyncState.waitingForPhone` with full "Waiting..." view in `ContentView`
- ✅ Watch: `WorkoutSyncState.pendingPhoneRequest` — "Start Workout? / iPhone is ready" prompt
- ✅ iPhone: `isWaitingForWatch` overlay in `HomeView` with cancel button

**Step 3: Local Notifications** ✅
- ✅ `NotificationService.swift` — posts local notification when watch requests workout

**Step 4: `applicationContext` Fallback** ✅
- ✅ Watch: sets `applicationContext` with `pendingWorkoutRequest: true` when phone not reachable
- ✅ iPhone: sets `applicationContext` with `pendingWorkoutRequest: true` when watch not reachable
- ✅ Both: check `receivedApplicationContext` on activation

**Step 5: Echo Prevention** ✅
- ✅ `sendToWatch: Bool` parameter on all `RunSessionViewModel` workout control methods
- ✅ `triggeredRemotely: Bool` in `WorkoutManager.startWorkout()`
- ✅ All state-sync callbacks (pause/resume/finish/discard/dismiss) guard against re-sending

**Step 6: Full Workout Flow Integration** ✅
- ✅ Watch `WorkoutManager` observes `"PhoneCommand"` notification
- ✅ iPhone `HomeView` shows "Waiting for Watch" overlay and navigates on confirmation
- ✅ Watch can accept or decline phone-initiated workout request
- ✅ BPM Lock state synced bidirectionally (phone ↔ watch)
- ✅ Now Playing info sent from phone to watch
- ✅ Workout summary on watch shows avg HR + cadence after finish

#### Files Created

**iOS:**
- ✅ `PulseTempo/Services/WatchConnectivityManager.swift` — Full hybrid messaging + applicationContext
- ✅ `PulseTempo/Services/NotificationService.swift` — Local notification management

**watchOS:**
- ✅ `PulseTempo Watch App Watch App/PhoneConnectivityManager.swift` — Full bidirectional messaging
- ✅ `PulseTempo Watch App Watch App/WorkoutManager.swift` — All `WorkoutSyncState` cases handled
- ✅ `PulseTempo Watch App Watch App/ContentView.swift` — All sync state UI: idle, waitingForPhone, pendingPhoneRequest, active, paused, confirmingDiscard, showingSummary, stopping

## Immediate Next Steps

> **Last reviewed: March 1, 2026.** Core phases 1–4 are functionally complete. The app has a full working workout loop: onboarding → auth → playlist selection → active run (HR + cadence BPM matching) → watch sync → run saved to backend. The items below are what's outstanding before TestFlight / Phase 5.

### 🔥 High Priority

1. ✅ **HeartRateService** — Core differentiator (COMPLETED)
2. ✅ **Integrate MusicKit** — Essential for actual music control (COMPLETED)
3. ✅ **Add Demo Mode** — Enable development without wearable (COMPLETED)
4. ✅ **RunSessionViewModel** — HR + cadence BPM matching with BPM Lock (COMPLETED)
5. ✅ **Playlist selection UI** — Multi-playlist support with MusicKit (COMPLETED)
6. ✅ **FastAPI backend** — Auth, tracks, runs, BPM analysis on Railway (COMPLETED)
7. ✅ **BPM lookup** — librosa audio analysis via Apple Music preview URLs (COMPLETED)
8. ✅ **watchOS Companion App** — HR/cadence streaming, all sync states (COMPLETED)
9. ✅ **Bidirectional Workout Sync** — Full hybrid messaging, applicationContext fallback, echo prevention (COMPLETED)
10. ⚠️ **Sign in with Apple end-to-end** — `apple_auth.py` exists but `/api/auth/apple` route not wired; iOS side not connected
11. ⚠️ **Secure `/tracks/analyze` endpoint** — Auth is commented out (`# TODO: Re-enable auth for production`) — open to public right now

### 🟡 Medium Priority

12. ⏳ **Backend tests** — `backend/tests/` is empty; auth/tracks/runs all untested
13. ⏳ **End-to-end manual testing with real Apple Watch** — All the sync code is written, needs real hardware validation
14. ⏳ **Offline run history caching** — Run history requires live backend; no local CoreData/SwiftData fallback

### 🟢 Future (Phase 5+)

15. ⏳ **AI DJ Feature** — Motivational voice prompts via OpenAI + AVSpeechSynthesizer
16. ⏳ **Cadence matching post-launch tuning** — Feature is implemented; needs real runner validation
17. ⏳ **App Store preparation** — Assets, screenshots, privacy policy, TestFlight beta

## Demo Mode Strategy (No Wearable Device)

**Context:** Development is proceeding without wearable hardware. This strategy enables full development and testing without requiring an Apple Watch or Garmin Venu 3S.

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1A: Demo Mode Development** (Current)
- Enhance HeartRateService with realistic HR simulation
- Implement workout pattern simulation:
  - Warm-up phase: 100-120 BPM (gradual increase)
  - Steady state: 140-150 BPM (slight variations)
  - Intense intervals: 160-175 BPM (peaks)
  - Cool-down: 120-100 BPM (gradual decrease)
- Add settings toggle for Demo Mode vs. Wearable Mode (Apple Watch or Garmin)
- Build and test entire app with simulated data

**Phase 1B: Wearable Integration** (When hardware arrives)
- **Apple Watch**: Test real HealthKit integration via WatchConnectivity
- **Garmin Venu 3S**: Test HealthKit sync or Garmin Health SDK integration
- Validate HR accuracy and responsiveness for both devices
- Compare demo patterns vs. real workout data
- Fine-tune BPM matching algorithm with real data
- Keep demo mode for users without compatible wearable

### Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Continue Development** - No blocked work while waiting for wearable hardware
✅ **Test BPM Matching** - Validate track selection algorithm
✅ **Build Complete UI** - All screens and flows can be implemented
✅ **Demo Ready** - Show app to users/investors without physical device
✅ **Future-Proof** - Easy toggle when wearable devices arrive
✅ **Broader Audience** - Support users without Apple Watch or Garmin (demo mode)

### Demo Mode Features

1. **Realistic Simulation**
   - Time-based HR progression
   - Natural variation (±3-5 BPM)
   - Workout phase detection
   
2. **Manual Override**
   - User can adjust simulated HR
   - Useful for testing specific BPM ranges
   
3. **Settings Integration**
   - Clear indicator when in Demo Mode
   - Easy switch between Demo / Apple Watch / Garmin Venu 3S modes
   - Persist user preference

---

## Notes

- **Start small**: Focus on core BPM matching before adding AI DJ
- **Test early**: Get real runners testing as soon as Phase 3 is complete
- **Battery matters**: Optimize for battery life throughout development
- **Privacy first**: Be transparent about data collection and usage
- **Iterate quickly**: Use TestFlight feedback to prioritize features
- **Demo Mode**: Enables full development without wearable hardware (Apple Watch or Garmin)
